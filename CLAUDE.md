This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Generative Engine Optimization(GEO) is an emerging field, analogous to SEO. Where SEO was focused on the product's placement on a search engine like Google, GEO is concerned with the likelyhood an LLM suggests your product

Perplexity.ai offers a unified platform for utilizing various LLMs for web searches, making it the perfect platform for gaining insight into your current GEO standing.

We will be utilizing Playwright to write simple scripts automating GEO research on Perplexity.
